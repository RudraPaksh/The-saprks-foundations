Hello 

Developed REST API using Django
the API can perform basic CRUD Operations i.e

1.C- Create
2.R-Read
3.U-Update
4.D-Delete

the tools used to sent request to the server is POSTMAN (for tetsngthe working of our web app)

i have created examples
1.EMployee data 



i have used sqlite database for storing my records.

first i will start server using commnnd python manage.py runserver

server started sucessfully 
now sent the request to server using POSTMAN 
for fetching all the existing data we will make GET equest
read operation has been performed

for creating a new rcord we will send POST request and pass the data ina JSON fromate
record created successfully.

for getting a particular record we will use 'id' field of that record which is used as aprimary key
to update a record we will send PUT  request to server if record not exits it will show that record dont exits
else record update sucessfully

last to delete record we can send DELETE rquest to the server and specify the id of record to be deleted


this is all about the project 

thank you THE SPARKS FOUNDATION
